PyCity Schools Overview
<br>
<li>Smaller schools with less than 1,000 students had a 95% overall passing rate and out-perform the largest schools with student sizes over 3,500, which had a 74% passing rate. These smaller schools also show out-performance in math scores over the larger schools (84 vs 77). Each of these smaller schools were charter schools.</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>There is a trend across both charter and district schools that students achieve higher scores in reading than math. Overall, half (50%) of students achieved a reading score of at least 82 , whereas half (50%) of students achieved math scores at a significantly lower score of at least 72. And, students who perform well in reading or math are not necessarily likely to achieve high scores in both. More research needs to be done to understand if these math scores distributions are on par, above, or below national averages. </li>
<br>
<br>
<li>97% of students across charter schools pass reading (score of 70 or higher). But, while there is a high passing rate in charter schools, the overall average reading score stayed roughly static at 84 across 9th thru 12th grade students. Notably, Holden High School showed a 9th grade student passing rate of 94% and a 12th grade student passing rate of 99%, with the average reading score improving between 9th grade students (84) and 12 grade students (85). </li>
<br>
<br>
<li>Within the district Schools, 67% of students pass math. Notably in the district schools, Figueroa High School was an outlier, showing a 9th grade student passing rate of 64% and a 12th grade student passing rate of 69%. More research could be done to understand the cause of this improvement, and any such valid insight could be transferred to the remaining district schools. </li>

12/8:  Uploaded all required and analyses on time

12/9 10am:  I wanted to review % of Students Passing Math and Reading across the schools to assess it.  But, didn't know the Python. I updated the analyses by exporting to csv and doing the assessment in Excel

12/9 7:50pm:  I spent the day learning the Python methods, indexing, and groupbys to do this analyses in Python vs Excel

The extraneous data was all that was adjusted, nothing else of the core assignment.  And, the data was indeed found to be interesting, and note worthy to report on.
