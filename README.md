City School Analyses

Main ibpy program PyCitySchools_dab.ibpy :

12/8:  Uploaded all required and analyses on time

12/9 10am:  I wanted to review % of Students Passing Math and Reading across the schools to assess it.  But, didn't know the Python. I updated the analyses by exporting to csv and doing the assessment in Excel

12/9 7:50pm:  I spent the day learning the Python methods, indexing, and groupbys to do this analyses in Python vs Excel

The extraneous data was all that was adjusted, nothing else of the core assignment.  And, the data was indeed found to be interesting, and note worthy to report on.
